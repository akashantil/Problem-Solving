	// The code works in similar line with the question of "finding the element
	// which appears once in an array - containing other elements each appearing
	// twice". Solution is to XOR all the elements and you get the answer.
	//
	// Basically, it makes use of the fact that x^x = 0. So all paired elements
	// get XOR'd and vanish leaving the lonely element.
	// Since XOR operation is associative, commutative.. it does not matter in
	// what fashion elements appear in array, we still get the answer.
	//
	// Now, in the current question - if we apply the above idea, it will not
	// work because - we got to have every unique element appearing even number
	// of times. So instead of getting the answer, we will end up getting XOR of
	// all unique elements which is not what we want.
	//
	// To rectify this mistake, the code makes use of 2 variables.
	// ones - At any point of time, this variable holds XOR of all the elements
	// which have
	// appeared "only" once.
	// twos - At any point of time, this variable holds XOR of all the elements
	// which have
	// appeared "only" twice.
	//
	// So if at any point time,
	// 1. A new number appears - It gets XOR'd to the variable "ones".
	// 2. A number gets repeated(appears twice) - It is removed from "ones" and
	// XOR'd to the
	// variable "twice".
	// 3. A number appears for the third time - It gets removed from both "ones"
	// and "twice".
	//
	// The final answer we want is the value present in "ones" - coz, it holds
	// the unique element.
	//
	// So if we explain how steps 1 to 3 happens in the code, we are done.
	// Before explaining above 3 steps, lets look at last three lines of the
	// code,
	//
	// not_threes = ~(ones & twos)
	// ones & = not_threes
	// twos & = not_threes
	//
	// All it does is, common 1's between "ones" and "twos" are converted to
	// zero.
	//
	// For simplicity, in all the below explanations - consider we have got only
	// 4 elements in the array (one unique element and 3 repeated elements - in
	// any order).
	//
	// Explanation for step 1
	// ------------------------
	// Lets say a new element(x) appears.
	// CURRENT SITUATION - Both variables - "ones" and "twos" has not recorded
	// "x".
	//
	// Observe the statement "twos| = ones & x".
	// Since bit representation of "x" is not present in "ones", AND condition
	// yields nothing. So "twos" does not get bit representation of "x".
	// But, in next step "ones ^= x" - "ones" ends up adding bits of "x". Thus
	// new element gets recorded in "ones" but not in "twos".
	//
	// The last 3 lines of code as explained already, converts common 1's b/w
	// "ones" and "twos" to zeros.
	// Since as of now, only "ones" has "x" and not "twos" - last 3 lines does
	// nothing.
	//
	// Explanation for step 2.
	// ------------------------
	// Lets say an element(x) appears twice.
	// CURRENT SITUATION - "ones" has recorded "x" but not "twos".
	//
	// Now due to the statement, "twos| = ones & x" - "twos" ends up getting
	// bits of x.
	// But due to the statement, "ones ^ = x" - "ones" removes "x" from its
	// binary representation.
	//
	// Again, last 3 lines of code does nothing.
	// So ultimately, "twos" ends up getting bits of "x" and "ones" ends up
	// losing bits of "x".
	//
	// Explanation for step 3.
	// -------------------------
	// Lets say an element(x) appears for the third time.
	// CURRENT SITUATION - "ones" does not have bit representation of "x" but
	// "twos" has.
	//
	// Though "ones & x" does not yield nothing .. "twos" by itself has bit
	// representation of "x". So after this statement, "two" has bit
	// representation of "x".
	// Due to "ones^=x", after this step, "one" also ends up getting bit
	// representation of "x".
	//
	// Now last 3 lines of code removes common 1's of "ones" and "twos" - which
	// is the bit representation of "x".
	// Thus both "ones" and "twos" ends up losing bit representation of "x".
	//
	// 1st example
	// ------------
	// 2, 2, 2, 4
	//
	// After first iteration,
	// ones = 2, twos = 0
	// After second iteration,
	// ones = 0, twos = 2
	// After third iteration,
	// ones = 0, twos = 0
	// After fourth iteration,
	// ones = 4, twos = 0
	//
	// 2nd example
	// ------------
	// 4, 2, 2, 2
	//
	// After first iteration,
	// ones = 4, twos = 0
	// After second iteration,
	// ones = 6, twos = 0
	// After third iteration,
	// ones = 4, twos = 2
	// After fourth iteration,
	// ones = 4, twos = 0
	//
	//
